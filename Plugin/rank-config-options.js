 * This is the rank system.
 * Each rank has a number assigned. The default values of each rank are equal to the ones used in the GBA FE games.
 * You can change those values if you want a different amount of points to reach each rank, 
 * and you can also add more ranks or remove the ones that are here.
 * The only two things you must keep is that the first rank must have a value of 0,
 * and that each rank must have a bigger value than the one before and lower that the one next to it.
